Hello!👋🏻 I'm a PhD student in computer science in the research training group ["Neuroexplicit models of language, vision, and action"](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/) where I am advised by Mariya Toneva. My research revolves around studying long-term memory in large language models and equipping them with better memory systems, inspired by the brain. I care a lot about general/foundational principles of what makes effective intelligent systems. Such principles should apply to both natural and artificial intelligent/cognitive systems.
Before coming to work with Mariya Toneva at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, I completed a M.Sc. in Cognitive Science. During that time I focused on both vision and RL in NeuroAI under the supervision of Tim Kietzmann and Adrien Doerig. Before I began my AI/ML focused studies in Cognitive Science, I began my interdisciplinary journey with formal training in philosophy and economics, which is what I did my Bachelor's degree in. 

When I'm not working on my research I like to go bouldering 🧗🏻‍♂️, play the guitar 🎸 (both electric and classical) and drink a lot of japanese green tea 🍵
If any of these things sound interesting to you, or you're based in SB and want to start a band or have a jam session, shoot me a message! I'm also always happy to talk about AI, neuroscience, cognitive science and philosophy.
