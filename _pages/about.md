I am a PhD student in computer science at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), working on enabling episodic memory for LLMs.
I am affiliated with the research training group ["Neuroexplicit Models of Language, Vision, and Action"](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/) and advised by [Mariya Toneva](https://mtoneva.com/) and [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html).

My research studies long-term memory in large language models and the design of more efficient memory architectures. In particular, I focus on episodic memory mechanisms as an alternative to expensive long-context processing. I am broadly interested in foundational principles of modular intelligent systems that apply to both biological and artificial cognition.

Before starting my PhD, I completed an M.Sc. in Cognitive Science at Osnabrueck University, where I worked on active foveated vision and reinforcement learning-based computer vision under the supervision of [Tim Kietzmann](https://www.kietzmannlab.org/) and [Adrien Doerig](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/Cognitive-Computational-Neuroscience/Adrien-Doerig/index.html). Earlier, I was formally trained in philosophy and economics.
