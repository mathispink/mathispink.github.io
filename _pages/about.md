Hello!👋🏻 I'm a PhD student in computer science and part of the research training group ["Neuroexplicit models of language, vision, and action"](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/) where I am advised by [Mariya Toneva](https://mtoneva.com/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) and [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html).
My research revolves around studying long-term memory in large language models and equipping them with better memory systems, inspired by the brain. More specifically, I focus on equipping AI systems with episodic memory as an alternative to expensive long-context. My core interests lie in understanding foundational principles of what makes effective intelligent systems work well in the presence of modularity. Such principles will apply to both natural and artificial intelligent/cognitive systems.

Before I started my PhD, I did an M.Sc. in Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University, where I focused on active foveated vision (training a computer vision models with Reinforcement Learning) under the supervision of [Tim Kietzmann](https://www.kietzmannlab.org/) and [Adrien Doerig](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/Cognitive-Computational-Neuroscience/Adrien-Doerig/index.html). Before starting my journey into AI/ML, I was formally trained in philosophy and economics.

When I'm not working on my research I like to play the guitar 🎸 (both electric and classical), go bouldering 🧗🏻‍♂️, shoot films🎥, and drink a lot of japanese green tea 🍵
If any of the above sounds interesting to you, shoot me a message! I'm also always happy to talk about anything related to AI, neuroscience, cognitive science and philosophy.
